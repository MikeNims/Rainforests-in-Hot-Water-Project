      <abstract>The GAP National Terrestrial Ecosystems - Ver 3.0 is a 2011 update of the National&#xD;
        Gap Analysis Program Land Cover Data - Version 2.2 for the conterminous U.S. The GAP&#xD;
        National Terrestrial Ecosystems - Version 3.0 represents a highly thematically detailed land&#xD;
        cover map of the U.S. The map legend includes types described by NatureServe's Ecological&#xD;
        Systems Classification (Comer et al. 2002) as well as land use classes described in the&#xD;
        National Land Cover Dataset 2011 (Homer et al. 2015). These data cover the entire&#xD;
        continental U.S. and are a continuous data layer. These raster data have a 30 m x 30 m cell&#xD;
        resolution. GAP used the best information available to create the land cover data; however&#xD;
        GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available.</abstract>
      <purpose>The mission of the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is to provide state, regional and&#xD;
        national biodiversity assessments of the conservation status of native vertebrate species&#xD;
        and natural land cover types and to facilitate the application of this information to land&#xD;
        management activities. The goal of GAP is to keep common species common by identifying&#xD;
        species and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands.&#xD;
        Common species are those not currently threatened with extinction. By providing these data,&#xD;
        land managers and policy makers can make better-informed decisions when identifying priority&#xD;
        areas for conservation. The U.S. Geological Survey National Gap Analysis Program Land Cover&#xD;
        Data is complete for the conterminous United States. The national coverage has been clipped&#xD;
        to each of the 50 states, the 21 Landscape Conservation Cooperatives and 6 regions.This data&#xD;
        may represent one of these subsets.</purpose>

    <useconst>Inappropriate Uses: It is far easier to identify appropriate uses than inappropriate&#xD;
      ones, however, there is a "fuzzy line" that is eventually crossed when the differences in&#xD;
      resolution of the data, size of geographic area being analyzed, and precision of the answer&#xD;
      required for the question are no longer compatible. Examples include:&#xD;
 - Using the 2001&#xD;
      and 2011 land cover data sets to quantify change (see Data Use Constraints).&#xD;
 -Using the&#xD;
      data to map small areas (less than thousands of hectares), typically requiring mapping&#xD;
      resolution at 1:24,000 scale and using aerial photographs or ground surveys.&#xD;
 -Combining&#xD;
      these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale to produce new hybrid maps or answer&#xD;
      queries.&#xD;
 -Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest&#xD;
      thousand hectares &#xD;
 -Establishing exact boundaries for regulation or acquisition.&#xD;
      -Establishing definite occurrence or non-occurrence of any feature for an exact geographic&#xD;
      area&#xD;
 -Determining abundance, health, or condition of any feature.&#xD;
 -Establishing a&#xD;
      measure of accuracy of any other data by comparison with GAP data.&#xD;
 -Altering the data in&#xD;
      any way and redistributing them as a GAP data product.&#xD;
 -Using the data without acquiring&#xD;
      and reviewing the metadata.</useconst>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Throughout the land cover update process a series of reviews were conducted by the&#xD;
        National Gap Analysis Program analysts. Visual checks were done against high resolution&#xD;
        imagery accessed through Google Earth and ArcGIS base maps to assess the ground condition&#xD;
        for the 2011 time period. Areas of focus were those where the National Land Cover Dataset&#xD;
        class did not match the generalized GAP Land Cover (e.g. a forested ecological system&#xD;
        dominated by evergreen species where NLCD had mapped deciduous forest) and those areas where&#xD;
        the LANDFIRE disturbance layer indicated a moderate to severe disturbance had occurred. For&#xD;
        each geoarea one analyst was responsible for the update and a second reviewed each of the&#xD;
        land cover classes in the final updated dataset for the area. Once the updates were complete&#xD;
        the 2011 land cover dataset was created by mosaicing the individual files into a single&#xD;
        image. A class by class review of was then conducted to look for consistency in extent and&#xD;
        pattern for each of the 584 mapped classes. Where anomalies were identified a second review&#xD;
        was conducted to determine the potential source of the errors. Each class flagged in that&#xD;
        review was checked by a second analyst to determine the source of the errors and to rerun&#xD;
        the decision rules when needed. The initial land cover being updated, the mosaic for the&#xD;
        2001 National Gap Analysis Land Cover Ver 2 had undergone expert review in addition to&#xD;
        formal accuracy assessments for the Northwestern United States and the Southwestern portions&#xD;
        of the dataset. The full 2001 land cover had undergone similar class by class review both&#xD;
        during the creation of the regional maps, as well as after the full mosaic had been&#xD;
        created.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>The dataset has been extensively reviewed for logical accuracy by creating combinations&#xD;
      of the updated land cover datasets with initial dataset (the 2001 National Gap Analysis Land&#xD;
      Cover Dataset) and at each major step in the process to track which classes were being&#xD;
      impacted by each decision rule. If map classes that were not logically changed by the decision&#xD;
      rule changed, that information was used to track flaws in the scripts used to apply the&#xD;
      rules.</logic>
    <complete>A series of comparisons with regional or local datasets have been conducted throughout&#xD;
      the development of the initial 2001 Land Cover map and throughout the updating process. Given&#xD;
      the fact that the Ecological Systems Classification, the basis for the map legend in the&#xD;
      vegetated areas, was under development while some of the areas were being mapped, the concepts&#xD;
      represented in the map are specific to the concept at the time the mapping was conducted.&#xD;
      Combinations of the Ecological Systems mapped distribution and range maps for those systems&#xD;
      have been created to identify map units in which further review and refinement would be useful&#xD;
      for refining future detailed land cover maps.</complete>
